# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

My name is Erik. My pronouns are He/Him. I mainly play games like minecraft and league of legends, but the interest varies depending on my mood at the time. I've played all sorts of games from roguelike to soulslike to just chill relaxing games. I'm taking the class because I have a dream game that I want to make but am not experienced enough yet to do so. I have used unity before in high school to make a small game for another class, besides that, I'm fairly new to game dev. I want to make some roguelike games or some hack and slash type games because I have a vision that for those types of games I want to bring to life

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [ ] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [x] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided

I'm a CS major

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?
Learning about all the different little trinkets and tools
## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

Some C#, mainly java and python

2. Game development (any engine)

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**
